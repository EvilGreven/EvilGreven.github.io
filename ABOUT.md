      <h1>About OKQuakes</h1>
      <p>OKQuakes is a free and ad-free Android app.  I created it as a public service, as the data source is not my own, but pulls data from the United States Geological Service</p>
      <p>The earthquake list does not necessarily show every earthquake, nor is it updated all of the time.  Automated earthquake logging is limited, and many smaller earthquakes must be manually added.  Consequently, only bigger quakes will show up outside office hours.</p>
